# National Grid: Live

This repository contains the source code for [National Grid: Live](https://grid.iamkate.com/).

It has been modified to display the data in Scottish Gaelic. The localisation was carried out for and on behalf of Stòrlann Nàiseanta na Gàidhlig.

## Development

The development environment uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit the values as appropriate. At a minimum, `DATABASE_PASSWORD` must be given a value.

To start the containers:

```
docker compose up --detach
```

Once the containers are running, you can view the site at [http://localhost:9714/](http://localhost:9714/). Port 9714 was chosen due to its slight resemblance to the word ‘grid’.

To run the update script:

```
docker compose exec php php /var/grid/update.php
```

To stop the containers:

```
docker compose down
```

## Production

The production environment does not use Docker, instead running directly on the server. PHP 8.3 and a recent version MariaDB or MySQL are required.

Note that for the Stòrlann installation, the files are stored in `[dealanroot]/griod/` and the generated html is in `[dealanroot]/griod/public`.

The server has a cron job set up to run the update script every 5 minutes. This will need to be updated if the directory structure is ever changed.

The WP installation uses a plugin to embed the html from the generated file.

### Files

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit the values as appropriate. At a minimum, `DATABASE_PASSWORD` must be given a value. `DATABASE_HOSTNAME` should be changed to `localhost` if the database is running on the same server.

Upload `.env`, `update.php`, and the `classes` and `public` directories to the server.

### Database

Create a database and a user with `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` privileges, and import `grid.sql` into the database.

### Web server

Configure the server to serve the contents of the `public` directory. Note that this directory contains only static files, so the web server does not need to support PHP.

### Cron

Set up a cron job to execute the `update.php` script (using the [PHP CLI SAPI](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.usage.php)) every five minutes. The cron job must run as a user with write access to `public/favicon.svg` and `public/index.html`.

The script outputs details of the update process to standard output, and details of errors to standard error. An error with an individual data source does not abort the rest of the update process.

### Fonts

The CSS refers to `proza-light.woff2` and `proza-regular.woff2`. These are commercial fonts, so are not included in this repository. Licences for [Proza](http://bureauroffa.com/about-proza) can be purchased from [Bureau Roffa](http://bureauroffa.com/). Alternatively, the simplified free version [Proza Libre](http://bureauroffa.com/about-proza-libre) can be used instead.

### Cloudflare

National Grid: Live uses [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)’s content delivery network. Visit counts will be retrieved from Cloudflare if the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` environment variables are set to non-empty strings. The Cloudflare API token must be configured to provide Analytics Read access for the zone.

## Codebase structure

PHP classes can be found in the `classes` directory. The [Database](classes/Database.php) class directly within this directory is responsible for all database access. The other classes are divided into three namespaces:

The [Data](classes/Data) namespace contains classes for reading data from the various data sources, as documented further below.

The [State](classes/State) namespace contains classes representing the data needed to output the user interface. The [State](classes/State/State.php) class is the overall container; an instance of this class is returned by the `getState()` method of a `Database` instance.

The [UI](classes/UI) namespace contains classes that output the user interface. The [UI](classes/UI/UI.php) class has overall responsibility for outputting the HTML, while the [Favicon](classes/UI/Favicon.php) class outputs the dynamically-updated favicon.

## Data sources

### [Elexon Insights Solution](https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/)

This API, developed by Elexon, reports power generation connected to the national transmission network, interconnector imports and exports, and pricing.

Data is available in JSON format at 30-minute or 5-minute granularity.

PHP classes: [Generation](classes/Data/Generation.php), [Pricing](classes/Data/Pricing.php)

### [National Grid ESO Data Portal](https://data.nationalgrideso.com/)

This API, developed by National Grid ESO, estimates power generation from embedded solar and wind (generation connected to the local distribution network rather than the national transmission network).

Data is available in CSV format at 30-minute granularity. Estimates may be retrospectively updated.

PHP class: [Demand](classes/Data/Demand.php)

### [Carbon Intensity API](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/)

This API, developed by National Grid ESO and the University Of Oxford Department Of Computer Science, estimates the carbon intensity of electricity generation in grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour.

Data is available in JSON format at 30-minute granularity. Estimates may be retrospectively updated.

PHP class: [Emissions](classes/Data/Emissions.php)

## Future plans

Battery storage data isn’t yet shown. Elexon Insights Solution only reports on discharging of battery storage systems. Without charging being reported, this would lead to double-counting of generation.

I’m not currently planning any other major changes. I believe it’s better for a project like this to have a limited scope and a concise interface serving the general public than to attempt to offer specialised analysis for energy industry experts.
